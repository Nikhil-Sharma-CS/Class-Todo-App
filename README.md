# Data Flow

## Controller
-   *This section contains 1 class which uses APIs as mentioned below* :

* ### TodoController Class

    * @GetMapping("todos")
    * @GetMapping("getAllDone")
    * @GetMapping("getAllUndone")
    * @GetMapping("getById/{Id}")
    * @PostMapping("addTodos")
    * @PutMapping("updateStatus/{status}")
    * @DeleteMapping("deleteTodo/{Id}")

## Services
-  *This section contains 1 class with functions that helps API to perform their specific tasks* : 


* ### TodoService Class
    
    * List<Todo> getAll()
    * List<Todo> getAllDone()
    * List<Todo> getAllUndone()
    * getById(Integer id)
    * updateStatus(boolean status, Integer id)
    * deleteTodo(Integer id)
    * addTodos(List<Todo> todos)

## Model
- *This section contains 1 model as required by project named **Todo**. It has its relative datamembers in them which will be used as columns to store their respective data*.


##  Repository
- *This section contains 1 **Interface** named ITodomRepo.*

- *It extends JpaRepository Interface*.


## Database Design
- *In this section we used the models as mentioned in Model section, which are used as a table to store data*.
- *It also uses **Relational Database** and **JPA** to create datastructure*.
- *We use **MYSQL** which is a management system for relational data*

## Data Structure Used

- *We used **Relational database** along with **JPA** as the data source in this project*.

- *This kind of data persists forever and we use **SQL** to manipulate this data via MYSQL.*

## Summary

*This project performs the task of managing Todos with various types of API's like **Get, Post, Put, Delete***.

*This project is also connected to a relational data which is the data source of this project.*

*We used **MVC Architecture** to create this project. 
And this is created in **SpringBoot** using **Maven** and **Java**.*
